Key Uses of a Box Plot

Summarizes Distribution

Shows the median, quartiles (Q1 & Q3), and whiskers to summarize a dataset.

Helps identify skewness and spread at a glance.

Detects Outliers

Any data points outside the whiskers (beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range) are considered outliers.

Compares Multiple Distributions

Useful for comparing different categories side by side (e.g., test scores of different classes, stock prices over time).

Identifies Skewness & Symmetry

If the median is closer to Q1 or Q3, the data is skewed.

A symmetric box plot indicates a normally distributed dataset.

Handles Large Data Efficiently

Unlike histograms, box plots work well for large datasets without requiring binning.

When to Use a Box Plot?

✅ When you need a quick summary of data distribution.✅ When looking for outliers in a dataset.✅ When comparing multiple datasets side by side.✅ When analyzing skewness or data spread.

❌ Avoid using box plots if you need precise individual data points—use histograms or scatter plots instead.

Box Plot Example

Here is an example of a box plot showing the distribution of values for four categories (A, B, C, D). The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the horizontal line inside the box is the median, and the whiskers indicate the range of most of the data. Any points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.



Difference Between Mean and Median

Feature

Mean

Median

Definition

The sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order.

Formula



If  is odd: middle value, If  is even: average of two middle values.

Effect of Outliers

Sensitive to outliers; extreme values can skew the mean.

Resistant to outliers; not affected by extreme values.

Best Used For

Normally distributed data without extreme values.

Skewed distributions or when there are outliers.

Example

Scores: 10, 15, 20, 25, 100 → Mean = 34 (affected by 100).

Scores: 10, 15, 20, 25, 100 → Median = 20 (not affected by 100).

When to Use What?

Use Mean when data is symmetrically distributed and there are no outliers.

Use Median when data is skewed or contains outliers.
